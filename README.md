========================

The yGEMe (yeast genome scale model evaluation) toolbox is a MATLAB package for evaluating under different metrics _S. cerevisiae_ GEMs. If used in any form of academic publication, the following reference should be included:

_Benjamín J. Sánchez, Jens Nielsen. Genome scale models of yeast: Towards standardized evaluation and consistent -omic integration (under preparation)._

yGEMe was programmed by Benjamín J. Sánchez (@BenjaSanchez), Division of Systems and Synthetic Biology, Department of Biology and Biological Engineering, Chalmers University of Technology.

## Required Software:

* MATLAB (7.5 or higher)
* The COBRA toolbox (http://opencobra.sourceforge.net/openCOBRA/Welcome.html) or the RAVEN toolbox (http://biomet-toolbox.org/index.php?page=downtools-raven), both for MATLAB. Aditionally, you should add the corresponding folder to your MATLAB search path.
* A genome scale metabolic model (GEM) as a structure in your workspace
* Microsoft Office 2007 or higher (for excel processing of data)
